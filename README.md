### LOGS

```
Based on the code snippet I provided, here are a few other aspects you may need to consider:

Log Levels: The code I shared sets the log level to INFO. However, you may want to adjust the log level based on your requirements. 
The available log levels in increasing order of severity are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. You can set the desired log level by modifying the line logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO).

Log Formatting: The code uses a basic log formatting, which includes the log level, timestamp, and message. If you want to customize the log format further, you can modify the logging.basicConfig call by specifying a different format parameter. You can refer to the Python documentation for the logging module to explore various formatting options.

File Handler: The code provided only logs the messages to the console. If you want to log the messages to a file, you can add a FileHandler to the logger. This will allow you to store the logs in a file for future reference. Here's an example of how you can add a file handler:
```
```python 
file_handler = logging.FileHandler('log_file.txt')
file_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(file_handler)
```
> Exception Handling: This code includes the calculate_sum, read_file, and write_file functions, along with the exception handling for each operation. It also demonstrates example usages of the functions and logs the results using the logger.
Remember to replace the file names and customize the file operations inside the functions according to your specific requirements.

### DISCORD LOGGING :

> To integrate the Discord logging, you need to update the following sections of the code:

```
Replace "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" with your actual Discord bot token in the line client.run("YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN").
Replace 123456789 with the ID of the channel where you want to send the logs in the line channel_id = 123456789.
Make sure to install the discord library using pip install discord before running the code.
```

### UPDATES:

> Updated exception handling format to try-except blocks to implement MORE ROBUST ERROR handling for the ANTICHEAT. 
> ADDED DISCORD INTEGRATION/AUDIT LOG INTEGRATIONS
